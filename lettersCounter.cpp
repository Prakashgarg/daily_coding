constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice.
Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate
across the surface over many millions of years, while its interior remains
active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's
magnetic field, and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics. Earth's
atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is
received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by
atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse gases also play an important
role in regulating the surface temperature. A region climate is not only
determined by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating
oceans, among other factors. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones,
thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.";
